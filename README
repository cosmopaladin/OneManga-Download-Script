NOTE: I am not responsible for any trouble you get into or cause using this
script. Please use it at your own risk.


This is a simple script to download manga chapters off of OneManga.com (they
don't have download links, only the ability to view manga online). This script
parses pages and deduces the correct URL's for all the manga images, downloads
them sequentially, and produces a CBZ file (Comic Book Archive) for viewing.
CBZ files can be opened in document viewers like Evince or comic book viewers
like Comix. I recommend Comix for viewing, as it has a manga mode, double page
mode, and a variety of a features that make reading manga or comics a pleasure.

Also, because this script downloads pictures from OneManga.com and uses up
their bandwith without reciprocating by clicking ads or generating pageviews,
please be nice and click a few of their ads. If they cannot get enough ad
revenue, they cannot keep the site up and all that manga will be gone. So
remember, be nice and don't overuse this.

If you encounter any bugs while using this software, please be kind enough to
file a bug on the github page
(http://github.com/techwizrd/OneManga-Download-Script/issues). I will fix any
bugs as soon as possible (usually within hours or days). Thank you for using
this script responsibly.
