OneManga Download Script

NOTE: I am not responsible for any trouble you get into using this script.
Use it at your own risk.


A simple script to download manga chapters off of OneManga.com (they don't have
download links, only the ability to view manga online). This script parses
pages and deduces the correct URL's for all the manga images, downloads them
sequentially, and produces a CBZ file (Comic Book Archive) for viewing. CBZ
files can be opened in document viewers like Evince or comic book viewers like
Comix. I recommend Comix for viewing, as it has a manga mode, double page mode,
and a variety of a features that make reading manga or comics a pleasure.

Also, because this script downloads pictures from OneManga.com and uses up
their bandwith without reciprocating by clicking ads or generating pageviews,
please be nice and click a few of their ads. If they cannot get enough ad
revenue, they cannot keep the site up and all that manga will be gone. So
remember, be nice and don't overuse this.
